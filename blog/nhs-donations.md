				The COVID-19 lockdown has changed the landscape of the food and drink industry overnight. Restaurants are having to adapt to stay afloat and support their workers while closing their physical doors to the public. Nevertheless, the biggest burden is being felt by our NHS and other essential services, who are tasked with keeping us safe and healthy during this unprecedented time. 
			</p>
			<p> The Flourish team have been amazed by the number of independent restaurants that have set aside their profit margins to help support key workers on the frontline of the health crisis. Read on for how you can contribute to help feed and support our NHS #stayathomesavelives</p>

					<h4>1. Mildreds</h4>
					<p>
						Mildreds has a special place in the heart of Londoners as one of the first places offering a fully vegan dining experience that lived up to our expectations of what restaurant quality food should be. Now after more than 30 years of feeding the capital’s veggies (and their open-minded carnivorous friends) they’re retooling for a different challenge.  
					</p>
					<p>  
						Temporarily closing all of its stores, the Mildreds team are now putting all their efforts into providing 400 meals a week to 4 London hospitals. They’re providing the recipes, cooking and delivery but need help to make the operation sustainable.  Be a true local hero by donating below.

					<h4>2. Berber and Q</h4>
					<p>
						Since 2015, Berber & Q have put Haggerston’s sleepy overground station on the culinary map of many Londoners who previously thought that the orange line ended at Shoreditch High Street.  Serving up a heady mix of Ottolenghi-style ingredients with hard hitting Mangal flavours, B&Q is now certified as a firm favourite in the East London food scene.  
					</p>
					<p>
						Whilst temporarily closed to the public, they’ve taken on a new guise as Berber & You with a goal to cook and deliver free nutritious meals to NHS wards in London. 100% of the amounts donated will be spent on supplies and staff to make this happen.  They delivered their first meals to the NHS on Monday but need further donations to keep the operation going.  Donate to this great initiative below.

					<h4>3. Angelina</h4>
					<p>
						Whilst many have quite rightly been focusing their attention on our doctors and nurses during the ongoing health crisis, other vulnerable groups within society, some who may have to isolate for up to 12 weeks, also need our help and support! 
					</p>
					<p>
						We were thrilled to hear about the efforts of Dalston restaurant Angelina, who have teamed up with local charity Made in Hackney to deliver free meals to some of Hackney’s most vulnerable residents.  Angelina’s kitchen, which usually  serves up an innovative menu of Italo-Japanese fusion dishes, is now working overtime to create nutritious plant-based meals on a menu specially crafted by NHS dieticians.  Angelina is already serving-up more than 300 of these meals per day but will only be able to continue with financial support from the public.

					<h4>4. Feed our Frontline</h4>
					<p>
						Whilst our mission at Flourish is focused around publicising and supporting independent businesses, we wanted to include a feature on a nationwide charitable effort to keep our key workers fed.
					</p>
					<p>
						Feed Our Frontline, which is  led by high-street restaurant LEON, has set itself the heady goal of providing 6,000 meals a day for critical care staff in our NHS hospitals across the country. The FoF campaign is being supported by a range of partners across the food industry including some of London’s favourites including Rosa’s Thai, Mr Bao and Dishoom.  Along with food donations and free delivery services, the campaign is looking to the public for support and has already raised half of its initial £1million target.

			<h4>Other spots helping out that we love</h4>
			<p>
				Alongside donations, other independents in London are offering matched donations and other offers to let you do your bit and support the NHS. We’ve highlighted a few of our favourites.
			</p>
			<h5 class="mt-4">Lumberjack</h5>
			<p>
				Camberwell cafe Lumberjack is staying true to its community roots by offering you the chance to pay forward a meal that they will deliver directly to the NHS.  Choose from a £6 or £12 bundle and stay tuned to their instagram for updates on how these delicious breakfasts and lunches are making their way to the frontline. 
			</p>
			<a href="https://shop.wearelumberjack.co.uk/collections/buy-a-meal-for-an-nhs-worker">Buy an NHS worker a meal</a>
			<h5  class="mt-4">Crosstown Doughnuts</h5>
			<p>
				The arrival of that signature black box of Crosstown Doughnuts is enough to make even the most hardworking of offices (home offices for now!) grind to a halt. Now you can order heavily discounted doughnuts to be sent to hospitals so our NHS heroes can enjoy one of their delicious round treats.
			</p>
			<a href="https://www.crosstowndoughnuts.com/doughnut-donation/">Make a Doughnut Donation</a>
			<h5 class="mt-4">Yard Sale Pizza</h5>
			<p>
				If there’s one food that can match the excitement of a free box of doughnuts, it’s a pizza delivery. Fortunately Yard Sale Pizza have stepped up and, like Crosstown, are offering you the chance to pay for a pizza order that they’ll deliver straight to the NHS at a significant discount. If you happen to have an extra £20 in your pocket this weekend that was earmarked for your video chat pub session, using it to deliver pizza for 14 NHS key workers is your chance to do your bit and #stayathomesavelives.
