			<p>The past few weeks have seen difficult adjustments aross many areas of society with the COVID-19 lockdown.  The food and drink industry has seen its landscape shift overnight and is having to adapt to support their staff and stay afloat whilst closing their (physical) doors to the public.  Nevertheless, there’s widespread appreciation that the biggest burden is being felt by our essential services, particularly the NHS, who are tasked with keeping us safe and healthy during this unprecedented time. </p>
			<p>While building the <a href="https://thelist.letsflourish.co/">Flourish List</a>, we’ve been amazed by the number of independent restaurants that are putting all their efforts into helping support our key workers on the frontline. We put a list of these together below to share how you can contribute to their efforts and be a local hero. #stayathomesavelives. </p>

					<h4>1. Mildreds</h4>
					<p>Mildreds has a special place in the heart of many London diners as one of the first places offering a fully vegetarian and vegan dining experience that lived up to our expectations of what restaurant quality food should be. Now after more than 30 years of feeding the capital’s veggies (and their open-minded carnivorous friends) they’re retooling for a different challenge.
					</p>
					<p>  
					Temporarily closing all of its locations, the Mildreds team are now putting all their efforts into providing 400 meals a week to 4 London hospitals. They’re providing the cooking and delivery services along with the all important recipes but need help to make the operation sustainable.  Be a true local hero by donating via their link below.

					<h4>2. Berber and Q</h4>
					<p>Since opening in 2015, Berber & Q has put Haggerston’s sleepy overground station on the culinary map of many Londoners who previously thought that the orange line ended at Shoreditch High Street.  Serving up a heady mix of Ottolenghi-style ingredients with hard hitting Mangal flavours, B&Q is now certified as a firm favourite in the East London food scene (and a favourite of this author!).  
					</p>
					<p>
					Whilst temporarily closed to the public, they have taken on a new guise as Berber & You.  Berber & You is the B&Q team’s initiative to produce and deliver free nutritious meals to NHS wards in London and they have guaranteed that 100% of amounts donated will be spent on supplies and staff to make this happen.  An initial wave of donations allowed the team to deliver their first meals to the NHS this Monday but they are reliant on further donations to keep the operation going and maximise their deliveries to London’s NHS heroes.  Donate to this great initiative via the link below.

					<h4>3. Angelina</h4>
					<p>Whilst many have quite rightly been focusing their attention on the efforts of our doctors and nurses during the ongoing health crisis, other vulnerable groups within society, some who may have to stay isolated for up to 12 weeks, will also need our help and support! 
					</p>
					<p>
					We were therefore thrilled to hear about the efforts of Hackney-based restaurant Angelina, who have teamed up with local cookery school and charity Made in Hackney to deliver free meals to some of Hackney’s most vulnerable residents.  Angelina’s kitchen, which usually  serves up an innovative menu of Italo-Japanese fusion dishes, is now working overtime to create nutritious plant-based meals on a menu specially crafted by NHS dieticians.  At their last count, Angelina are serving-up more than 300 of these meals per day but will only be able to continue this service as long as it is supported by public donations.

					<h4>4. Feed our Frontline</h4>
					<p>Whilst our mission at Flourish is focused around publicising and supporting independent businesses, the public’s efforts to support our NHS heroes calls for a collective action, so we wanted to include a feature on another charitable effort doing wonders to help keep our key workers fed.
					</p>
					<p> Feed Our Frontline is being spearheaded by TV actors like Damien Lewis, Helen McCrory and Matt Lucas alongside high-street restaurant LEON.  The FoF campaign have a goal of providing 6,000 meals a day for critical care staff in NHS hospitals across the country. The campaign is being supported by a range of food partners including some of London’s favourites including Rosa’s Thai, Mr Bao and Dishoom.  Along with food donations and free delivery services, the campaign is looking for financial support and has already raised half of its initial £1million target.

			<h4>Other spots helping out that we love</h4>
			<p>Alongside donations, other independents in London are offering matched donations and other offers to let you do your bit and support the NHS. We’ve highlighted a few of our favourites.</p>
			<h5 class="mt-4">Lumberjack</h5>
			<p>Camberwell cafe Lumberjack is staying true to its community roots by offering you the chance to pay forward a meal that they will deliver directly to the NHS.  Choose from a £6 or £12 bundle and stay tuned to their instagram for updates on how these delicious breakfasts and lunches are making their way to the frontline. </p>

			<h5  class="mt-4">Crosstown Doughnuts</h5>
			<p>The arrival of that signature black box of Crosstown Doughnuts is enough to make even the most hardworking of offices (home offices for now!) grind to a halt. Now Crosstown are doing their bit by allowing you to order a box of doughnuts with over 50% discounts, which they’ll delivery directly to NHS hospitals.</p>

			<h5 class="mt-4">Yard Sale Pizza</h5>

Fortunately Yard Sale Pizza have stepped up and, like Crosstown, are offering you the chance to pay for a pizza order that they’ll deliver straight to the NHS at a significant discount. If you happen to have an extra £20 in your pocket this weekend that was earmarked for your video chat pub session, using it to deliver pizza for 14 NHS key workers is your chance to do your bit and #stayathomesavelives.</p>
